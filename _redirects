# Netlify _redirects template. Documentation can be found on https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/.
#
# The _redirects file is included in _config.yml/include key otherwise Jekyll doesn't copy it to
# _site directory, where Netlify expects it.
#
# To create a new redirect, add an alternate_urls array in the page front-matter.

# Setting a layout forces Jekyll to render this file
layout: null
