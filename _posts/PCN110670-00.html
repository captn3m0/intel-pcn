</table><pre>Description of Change to the Customer:
Market demand for the products listed in the "Products Affected/Intel Ordering Codes" table below have
shifted to other Intel® products. The products identified in this notification will be discontinued and
unavailable for additional orders after the "Last Product Discontinuance Order Date" (see "Key
Milestones" above).

Customer Impact of Change and Recommended Action:
Please determine your remaining demand for these products and place your "Last Product Discontinuance
Orders" in accordance with the "Key Milestones" listed above. From date of PCN publication, interim
booking and turn back deadlines or separate Letter Agreements will apply vs. the standard Corporate
Assurance Process. The "Last Product Discontinuance Order Date" is the final day for customers to book
the Assurance Intel® has granted.
Boxed processors will not be available after boxed inventory is depleted (see "Key Milestones" above.)
Intel is offering tray processors to Intel® Authorized Distributors as a substitute for depleted boxed
processor inventory. Substitute tray processors are identified below in the "Boxed Processors Product
Table."
