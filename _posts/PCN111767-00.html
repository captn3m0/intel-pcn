</table><pre>Description of Change to the Customer:
Market demand for the products listed in the "Products Affected/Intel Ordering Codes" table below have
shifted to other Intel® products. The products identified in this notification will be discontinued and
unavailable for additional orders after the "Last Product Discontinuance Order Date" (see "Key
Milestones" above).

Customer Impact of Change and Recommended Action:
The Tray products listed on the "Products Affected/Intel® Ordering Codes" table should be managed in
accordance to the “Key Milestones” listed above. “Last Demand Due Date” is the date your remaining
demand for these products is due to your Intel representative. These products will only remain on Intel's
Corporate Assurance Process until the "Last Product Discontinuance Order Date”. The "Last Corporate
Assurance Product Critical Date" is the last date that customers should submit a request for product
utilizing Intel's standard Corporate Assurance Criticals Process. “Orders are Non-Cancellable and NonReturnable” date applies to both Corporate Assurance and backlog after the “Last Product Discontinuance
Order” date. At this date a snapshot will be taken of all remaining backlog and/or assurance and this
quantity will become non-cancellable. The "Last Product Discontinuance Order Date" is the final day for
customers who carry backlog to book the Assurance Intel® has granted as of the “NCNR Date”. For all
customers Corporate Assurance must be booked and shipped by the "Last Product Discontinuance
Shipment Date." From date of PCN publication, interim booking and turn back deadlines or separate
Letter Agreements will apply vs. the standard Corporate Assurance Process.
