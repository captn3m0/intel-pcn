</table><pre>Description of Change to the Customer:
Market demand for the products listed in the "Products Affected/Intel Ordering Codes" table below have
shifted to other Intel products. The products identified in this notification will be discontinued and
unavailable for additional orders after the "Last Product Discontinuance Order Date" (see "Key
Milestones" above).

Customer Impact of Change and Recommended Action:
The Tray products listed on the "Products Affected/Intel Ordering Codes" table should be managed in
accordance to the “Key Milestones” listed above. “Demand To Local Intel Representative” date is the
date your remaining demand for these products is due to your Intel representative. These products will
only remain on Intel's Corporate Assurance Process until the "Last Product Discontinuance Order Date”.
The "Last Corporate Assurance Product Critical Date" is the last date that customers should submit a
request for product utilizing Intel's standard Corporate Assurance Criticals Process. “Orders are NonCancellable and Non-Returnable” (NCNR) date applies to both Corporate Assurance and backlog after
the “Last Product Discontinuance Order Date.” At this date a snapshot will be taken of all remaining
backlog and/or assurance and this quantity will become non-cancellable. The "Last Product
Discontinuance Order Date" is the final day for customers who carry backlog to book the Assurance Intel
has granted as of the “NCNR” date. For all customers Corporate Assurance must be booked and shipped
by the "Last Product Discontinuance Shipment Date." From date of PCN publication, interim booking and
turn back deadlines or separate Letter Agreements will apply vs. the standard Corporate Assurance
Process.
