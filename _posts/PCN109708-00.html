</table><pre>Description of Change to the Customer:
Market demand for the Intel® Core™2 Quad Processor Q9400S products listed in the "Products
Affected/Intel Ordering Codes" table below have shifted to other Intel® products. The products identified
in this notification will be discontinued and unavailable for additional orders after the "Last Product
Discontinuance Order Date" (see "Key Milestones" above).

Customer Impact of Change and Recommended Action:
Please determine your remaining demand for these products and place your "Last Product Discontinuance
Orders" in accordance with the "Key Milestones" listed above. The tray products listed on the "Products
Affected/Intel® Ordering Codes" table below will remain on Intel's Corporate Assurance Process until the
"Last Product Discontinuance Order Date." The "Last Corporate Assurance Product Critical Date" is the
last date that customers may submit a request for product utilizing Intel's Corporate Assurance Criticals
Process. From date of PCN publication, interim booking and turn back deadlines or separate Letter
Agreements will apply vs. the standard Corporate Assurance Process. The "Last Product Discontinuance
Order Date" is the final day for customers to book the Assurance Intel® has granted after the "Last
Corporate Assurance Product Critical Date."
Boxed processors will not be available after boxed inventory is depleted (see "Key Milestones" above.)
Intel® is offering tray processors to Intel® Authorized Distributors as a substitute for depleted boxed
processor inventory. Substitute tray processors are identified below in the "Boxed Processors Product
Table."
