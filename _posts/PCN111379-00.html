</table><pre>Description of Change to the Customer:
Market demand for the products listed in the "Products Affected/Intel Ordering Codes" table below have
shifted to other Intel® products. The products identified in this notification will be discontinued and
unavailable for additional orders after the "Last Product Discontinuance Order Date" (see "Key
Milestones" above).

Customer Impact of Change and Recommended Action:
Please determine your remaining demand for these products and place your "Last Product Discontinuance
Orders" in accordance with the "Key Milestones" listed above. The tray products listed on the "Products
Affected/Intel® Ordering Codes" table below will remain on Intel's Corporate Assurance Process until the
"Last Product Discontinuance Order Date." "Finalize Discontinuance Assurance" is the date that

customers must submit a sales order or Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to hold the
discontinued product assurance they have requested. The "Last Corporate Assurance Product
Critical Date" is the last date that customers may submit a request for product utilizing Intel's Corporate
Assurance Critical Process. From date of PCN publication, interim booking and turn back deadlines or
separate Letter Agreements will apply vs. the standard Corporate Assurance Process. The "Last Product
Discontinuance Order Date" is the final day for customers to book the Assurance Intel® has granted after
the "Last Corporate Assurance Product Critical Date."
Boxed processors will not be available after boxed inventory is depleted (see "Key Milestones" above.)
Intel is offering tray processors to Intel® Authorized Distributors as a substitute for depleted boxed
processor inventory. Substitute tray processors are identified below in the "Boxed Processors Product
Table."
