</table><pre>Description of Change to the Customer:
Reason for revisions: Adding the i3-3220 China Boxed SKU
Market demand for the products listed in the "Products Affected/Intel Ordering Codes" table below have shifted
to other Intel products. The products identified in this notification will be discontinued and unavailable for
additional orders after the "Last Product Discontinuance Order Date" (see "Key Milestones" above).

Customer Impact of Change and Recommended Action:
Products listed in the "Products Affected/Intel Ordering Codes" table should be managed in accordance with the
"Key Milestones" listed above. The "Last Product Discontinuance Order Date" is the final day for customers who
carry backlog to book the orders Intel has granted as of the “Orders are Non-Cancellable and Non-Returnable
After” (NCNR) date. The “Orders are Non-Cancellable and Non-Returnable After” date applies to all remaining
backlog and/or orders after the “Last Product Discontinuance Order Date.” From date of PCN publication,
interim booking and turn back deadlines or separate Letter Agreements will apply vs. the standard Corporate
Assurance Process.
Boxed processors will not be available after boxed inventory is depleted (see "Key Milestones" above.) Intel is
offering tray processors to Intel Authorized Distributors as a substitute for depleted boxed processor inventory.
Substitute tray processors are identified below in the "Boxed Processors Product Table."
