</table><pre>Description of Change to the Customer:
Market demand for the Intel® Pentium® Dual-Core Processor E2160 has shifted to other Intel processors.
The products identified in this notification will be discontinued and unavailable for additional orders after
the "Last Product Discontinuance Order Date" (see "Key Milestones" above).

Customer Impact of Change and Recommended Action:
Please determine your remaining demand for these products and place your "Last Product Discontinuance
Orders" in accordance with the "Key Milestones" listed above. The tray products listed on the "Products
Affected/Intel Ordering Codes" table below will remain on Intel's Corporate Commit Process until the
"Last Product Discontinuance Order Date." The "Last Corporate Commit Hot List" is the last date that
customers may submit a request for product utilizing Intel's Corporate Commit Hot List Process (CCP).
From date of PCN publication, interim booking and turn back deadlines apply per standard CCP process.
The "Last Product Discontinuance Order Date" is the final day for customers to book the commits Intel has
granted after the "Last Corporate Product Hot List Date."
Boxed processors will not be available after boxed inventory is depleted (see "Key Milestones" above.)
Intel is offering tray processors to Intel Authorized Distributors as a substitute for depleted boxed processor
inventory. Substitute tray processors are identified below in the "Boxed Processors Product Table".
