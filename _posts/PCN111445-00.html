"Last Product Discontinuance Order Date." From date of PCN publication, interim booking and turn
back deadlines or separate Letter Agreements will apply vs. the standard Corporate Assurance Process.
The "Last Product Discontinuance Order Date" is the final day for customers to book the Assurance
Intel® has granted.
