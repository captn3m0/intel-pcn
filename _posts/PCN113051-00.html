</table><pre>Description of Change to the Customer:
Market demand for the products listed in the "Products Affected/Intel Ordering Codes" tables below have
shifted to other Intel products. The products identified in this notification will be discontinued and
unavailable for additional orders after the "Last Product Discontinuance Order Date" (see "Key
Milestones" above).

Customer Impact of Change and Recommended Action:
The products listed in the "Products Affected/Intel Ordering Codes" tables should be managed in
accordance to the “Key Milestones” listed above. “Demand To Local Intel Representative” date is the
date your remaining demand for these products is due to your Intel representative. These products will
only remain on Intel's Corporate Assurance Process until the "Last Product Discontinuance Order Date”.
The "Last Corporate Assurance Product Critical Date" is the last date that customers should submit a
request for product utilizing Intel's standard Corporate Assurance Criticals Process. The "Last Product
Discontinuance Order Date" is the final day for customers who carry backlog to book the Assurance Intel
has granted as of the “Orders are Non-Cancellable and Non-Returnable After” (NCNR) date. NCNR date
applies to both Corporate Assurance and backlog after the “Last Product Discontinuance Order Date.”
At this date a snapshot will be taken of all remaining backlog and/or assurance and this quantity will
become non-cancellable. For all customers Corporate Assurance must be booked and shipped by the
"Last Product Discontinuance Shipment Date." From date of PCN publication, interim booking and turn
back deadlines or separate Letter Agreements will apply vs. the standard Corporate Assurance Process.
Boxed processors will not be available after boxed inventory is depleted (see "Key Milestones" above.)
Intel is offering tray processors to Intel Authorized Distributors as a substitute for depleted boxed
processor inventory. Substitute tray processors are identified below in the "Boxed Processors” product
table.
